                    Hello, my name is Angel Aguilar and I'm a full stack web developer from central Texas.
                I've always had an admiration for computer programming and having friends who were already
                in the field increased my curiosity for the field. So I have them to partially thank 
                for aspiring me to take the risk and initaite the action to make an interest into my career.

                    I recieved a strong background, experience, and understanding for this field by attending
                the University of Texas at San Antonio. I graduated with certification for full stack web development
                by the end of the year in 2022. Languages and some concepts that I have become proficient include: 
                Node.Js, MongoDb, React, Express, Restful API's, Progressive Web Applications, GraphQl, and 
                Computer Science.

                    When away from the computer, I enjoy spending my time by exercising, attending concerts, spending time with friends
                and family, and relaxing at home.
